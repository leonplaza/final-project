# final-project

For this project I'm going to calculate the enteprise value of companies using fundamental analysis discounted cash flow method and I'm extracting the necessary information from Yahoo-Finance and Damodaran Online.

There are many ways to valuate a firm, the two main approaches for valuating are Fundamental Analysis

Yahoo Finance provides financial statement from enterprises that are in the stock market from all parts of the world.

I'm extracting data from Damodaran online, which is a blog from connotaded NYU professor Aswath Damodaran. In this blog he posts his own estimations of relevant data that is used to valuate firms, such as discount rates, risk premiums, growth rates by industries and geographic location.

The purpose of this project is to integrate Damodaran's contributions to directly estimate the value of a firm.
